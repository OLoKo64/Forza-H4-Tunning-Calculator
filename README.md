# Forza-H4-Tunning-Calculator
Formula used by HokiHoshi

After some time doing by hand the calculations i decided to create this script, it is complete CLI based and don't need any requirements.

# How to use it
Install Python3.6+ 

And start the program with:

Windows:
"python FH4_Calculator.py"

Linux:
"python3 FH4_Calculator.py"


# To do
The code needs a top to botton rewrite for performance and usability reasons as i write it on my launch time without planning. All the calculations are correctly working.

# Version
Calculator version 0.01 (Alpha).
